Create a Test Directory
Open a Windows PowerShell interface by pressing Windows Key + x, and then i once the menu appears.
Create a new test directory (folder) by entering the following:
--mkdir git_test

Change your location to the newly created directory:
--cd git_test

Configure GitHub Credentials
Configure your local Git installation to use your GitHub credentials by entering the following:
--git config --global user.name "github_username"
--git config --global user.email "email_address"

Switch to your PowerShell window, and enter the following:
--git clone repository_url

List Remote Repositories
Your working directory should now have a copy of the repository from GitHub. It should contain a directory with the name of the project. Change to the directory:
-->cd git_project

Pushing Local Files to the Remote Repository
Once youâ€™ve done some work on the project, you may want to submit those changes to the remote project on GitHub.

1. For example, create a new text file by entering the following into your PowerShell window:
-->new-item text.txt

3. Now check the status of your new Git branch and untracked files:
-->git status

4. Add your new file to the local project:
-->git add text.txt

5. Run git status again to make sure the text.txt file has been added. Next, commit the changes to the local project:
-->git commit -m "Sample 1"

6. Finally, push the changes to the remote GitHub repository:
-->git push
